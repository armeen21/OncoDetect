**OncoDetect: AI-Powered Cancer Detection System**

OncoDetect is a machine learning project designed to assist in the early detection of cancerous cells from medical images. 
Utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the system achieves high accuracy in identifying cancerous versus non-cancerous cells, 
showcasing the potential of AI in healthcare diagnostics.



**Features**

	•	High Accuracy: Achieved a 97% accuracy rate in identifying cancerous cells during testing.
	•	Convolutional Neural Networks: Utilizes CNN architecture for image processing and classification.
	•	Scalable and Modular Design: Easily adaptable for different datasets or medical image classification tasks.



**Results**

OncoDetect has demonstrated the following performance metrics on the test dataset: 

  Accuracy: 97%
	
  Precision: 95%
  
  Recall: 96%
